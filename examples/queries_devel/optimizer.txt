List of optimizations needs be done on query plan(AST?)
--> Constant Folding:
    	     Simplify all the exrpessions in the query to constant
    	     values. For example table[ 1 == 1] should always be true.

--> Pushing Filter down to datasource:
    	    Filters should pushed as near to datasource in query plan
    	    as possible. This will help us to load less data before
    	    data processing.

--> Project Collapsing:
    	    Remove unnecessary projects from our query plan. For
	    example if we need only first project for our result then
	    get rid of second projection given that our relation only
	    contains two projections.

--> Booleexpression simplification:
    	    Simplify boolean expressions whose result can be computed
    	    without evaluating both sides
	    e.g. true || 23 => 23
	    	 a || a => a
		 not(true)  =>  false
		 if (true) a else b  =>  a

--> Combine Filters:
    	    Merge two adjacent Filters into one.
	    e.g. table[age> 25] table[age < 40] => table[25< age && 40> age]
	    
--> Simplify Filters:
    	     Remove filters where filters always evaluate to true or
    	     add empty relation when filters always evaluate to false

--> Combine Limits:
    	    Combine adjacent limit operations into one by merging expressions
